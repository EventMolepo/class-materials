# Course Description
This is a course in (mostly classical) microeconomic theory. Our goal is for you to become competent users of that theory. A secondary goal is to learn to read economic research critically. The way to achieve both of these goals is by practicing: that is, by solving lots of problems and reading lots of papers.

Below are the topics we will cover, stated "abstractly". However, this course is heavily biased towards applications; we want to use the theory to help us understand and explain real-world applications. As you will see, the scope of applications for these tools is very wide. I have also tended to pick readings that reflect my interests in development and labor economics, although not exclusively.

## Prerequisites
No prior knowledge of economics is strictly required, but you do need to understand how to solve a constrained optimization problem, and you need to know the envelope theorem. Basic algebra and calculus are required. You should also know how to compute the mean and variance of a random variable. Although we will cover some of these things in the first week, you may have to revise them on your own.

## Advice
I strongly encourage you to form study groups to help each other work on the problem sets and to discuss the readings. You will learn a lot more from your classmates than from me, if you take the time to seriously attempt the assignments.


# Required Texts
None. However, you may find useful complementary material in the following:

- @Becker2007a
- @Friedman1962
- @Stigler1987
- @McCloskey1985
- @Deaton1980a
- @Silberg2000

Several of these are hard to come by, but I have asked the library to put all of them on reserve. However, @McCloskey1985 is available for (free) download from her website, and @Deaton1980a is still relatively easy to find. @Becker2007a and @Friedman1962 are now available in Kindle format from Amazon, as is @Deaton1980a. 

The papers I have listed below are not strictly necessary, but I assume you will want to see how the ideas and models we will study have been applied. It always helps to see an idea from several different angles.

# Assessment
There will be 8 problem sets, a take-home midterm, and a final exam (in class).
