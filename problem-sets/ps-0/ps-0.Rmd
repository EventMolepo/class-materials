# Suggested Reading

Review these materials:

- David Autor's notes on math tools for microeconomics [(link)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-03-microeconomic-theory-and-public-policy-fall-2016/lecture-notes/MIT14_03F16_lec3MathTools.pdf)
- These notes from Royal Holloway's math camp [(link)](http://royalholloway.ac.uk/economics/documents/pdf/courseformsandinfo/ec5555lecture6(2013)-constrainedoptimsation.pdf)
- Martin Osborne's online tutorials on mathematical methods for economic theory [(link)](https://mjo.osborne.economics.utoronto.ca/index.php/tutorial/index/1/toc), sections 4 - 7.
- @Silberberg2000, Ch. 6 (comparative statics) 
- @Silberberg2000, Ch. 7 (envelope theorem)

Sindi has made copies of the chapters from @Silberberg2000, but you can also find the book on reserve at the library. The appendix to @Varian1992 is also useful for these topics. You may also want to review your undergraduate notes or textbooks on calculus, and on constrained optimization. 

The Osborne notes (linked above) are a good review of calculus and the basic theory of convex functions. I'll assume you know all the material in sections 1 - 3 of those notes.

# Exercises
We will be using the above techniques often this semester. Try the exercises below and we will discuss the solutions in the first week of classes.

## Constrained Optimization

1. Let
$$
f(x,y) = (x - 3y + 1)^2 + y^2 + 4.
$$

Solve the problem 

$$
\min_{x \geq 0, y \geq 0} f(x,y)
$$
subject to the constraint $x + y = 4$. How do you know you have found a (local) minimum and not a maximum?

2. If $f(x,y) = x^2 -\log x + xy$, solve

\begin{eqnarray}
\max_{x \geq 0, y \geq 0} f(x,y) & \text{s.t.} & x + y = 10
\end{eqnarray}

Is there an interior solution to this problem?

3. Suppose $\alpha$ is a known constant. Solve

\begin{eqnarray*}
\max_{x, y} 4x + \alpha y & \text{s.t.} & x^2 + y^2 \leq 25 \\
&& x \geq 0 \\
&& 4 \geq y \geq 0 
\end{eqnarray*}

Which of the constraints bind at the solution? Which are slack? How (if at all) does your answer depend on $\alpha$?

4. Minimize $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + (z-3)^2$ subject to the constraints

\begin{eqnarray}
x + 2y & \geq & 4 \\
x + y + z & \geq & 6.
\end{eqnarray}

## Envelope Theorem

5. Let 

$$
V(a) = \max_{x,y} 4 - x^2/2 -4y \text{ s.t. } 6x - 4y \leq a
$$

Compute the optimal choice of $x$ and $y$ (they may depend on $a$), and thus find $V(a)$. If $\lambda$ is the multiplier on the constraint $6x - 4y \leq a$, can you express $V'(a)$ in terms of $\lambda$?

6. Same as question 5 above, but with the objective $2xy + 3x$ and subject to the constraint $x + 2y \leq a$.
